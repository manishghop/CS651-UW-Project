Extrapolate this out, especially with good counties left to count, and @realDonaldTrump wins Arizona.üö®Let's be clear. This election won't be over when Trump says it's over. It will be over after every vote is counted. That includes mail-in ballots postmarked on Election Day, as well as military ballots. This is a democracy. Whether Trump likes it or not, we count every vote.Deleted my tweet after learning that there are shenanigans here in AZ. Up to 1M Republican votes missing from today. Trump needs to send lawyers.
